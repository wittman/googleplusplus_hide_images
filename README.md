# GooglePlusPlus Hide Images

`googleplusplus_hide_images` is a user script for Google Plus (aka Google+ aka G+) that adds a button under each Google Plus post image to hide it (toggle show / hide). Hides the image on original post *and all shared posts*. Tired of an animated GIF that keeps getting shared over and over in different posts? - hide it once an forget about it.

So far, this userscript / extension was tested on Google Chrome 12 and Firefox 5 with [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) ([download](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748/)) and should also work in Safari with the plugin [NinjaKit](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/os0x/20100612/1276330696) ([download](http://ss-o.net/safari/extension/NinjaKit.safariextz)).
