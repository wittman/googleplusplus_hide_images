# GooglePlusPlus Hide Images

`googleplusplus_hide_images` is a user script for Google Plus (aka Google+ aka G+) that adds a button under each Google Plus post image to hide it (toggle show / hide). Hides the image on original post *and all shared posts*. Tired of an animated GIF that keep getting shared over and over in different posts? - hide it once an forget about it.

So far, this user script was tested in Google Chrome 12 and Firefox 5 (Greasemonkey required) (on OS X).

Feedback is welcome.
